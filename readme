Got it working... (Instructions below). I am still having an issue getting the touch part working though. First download extract and copy the mzl350i-pi-ext folder and copy it over to your /home/pi folder using Cyberduck or some other program via SSH. Then do the following in order. Enjoy!

nano /boot/config.txt

Then change
#framebuffer_width=1280
#framebuffer_height=720
to
framebuffer_width=960
framebuffer_height=640
(Then Press Ctrl + X to exit, Then Y to save and then hit enter to overwrite file with changes)

sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install build-essential
cd /home/pi/mzl350i-pi-ext/src
make
sudo cp /home/pi/mzl350i-pi-ext/lcd /etc/init.d/
sudo chmod 755 /etc/init.d/lcd
sudo update-rc.d lcd defaults
reboot

If anyone can help me get the touch part working I would be more than happy and would give this screen 5 stars. As, I did not buy it primarily for the touch part I am still fairly satisfied.
